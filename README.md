## Tech

Fütag uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Firebase] - Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps.
- [SDWebImage] - Asynchronous image downloader with cache support with an UIImageView category
- [SwiftSoup] - is a pure Swift library, cross-platform (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS and Linux!), for working with real-world HTML. 
- [Cocoa Pods] - CocoaPods is the dependency manager for Objective-C projects. It has thousands of libraries and can help you scale your projects elegantly.
- [Lottie] - for using animation.
- [Alamofire] - is an HTTP networking library written in Swift.
- [Kingfisher] - is a powerful, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web. It provides you a chance to use a pure-Swift way to work with remote images in your next app.
